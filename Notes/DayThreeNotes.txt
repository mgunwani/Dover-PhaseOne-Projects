.NET Framework vs. .Net Core:

Programming with C#:

C - printf and scanf (Header Files: #include<stdio.h>)
C++ - cout and cin (Header File: #include<iostream.h>)
	
Input/Output:

Namespace(System) -> Class(Console) -> Methods (ReadLine, Read, WriteLine, Write)

Namespace -> Class -> Methods and Properties.

Namespace is a collection of classes, interfaces, delegates, enums and so on.
Class is a collection of data members(properties) and member functions (Methods)
Properties or Data Members are the variables declared at class level.
Methods or Member Functions are methods declared at class level.

Data Types:

1. Value Types:

	Simple Data Types (Integral, Floating-Point, Char, Boolean)
	Enum Types
	Struct Types
	Nullable Types
	
2. Reference Types:

	Class Types
	Interface Types
	Array Types
	Delegate Types

Type Casting:

Type Casting or Type Conversion is a mechanism to convert one data type to another one. Type Conversion is generally used when we do input or output operations. But Type Casting gets implicited in case of calculations.

1. Implicit Type Casting

	It is done by compiler automatically and there no data loss chances.
	It includes conversion of a smaller data type into the larger data type.
	This is also known as type-safe-conversion.

2. Explicit Type Casting

	It is done by developer based upon the storage type of variable.
	It includes conversion of a larger data type into the smaller data type.
	It is un-safe type conversion.

Conditional Constructs:

	Simple If Statement
	If..Else Statement
	If..Else If..Else Statement
	Nested If..Else Statement
	Switch Statement

Looping Constructs:

	For Loop
	While Loop
	Do..While Loop
	Enhanced ForEach Loop

Non-Conditional Constructs:

	Break
	Continue
	GoTo
	Comments

Arrays in C#:

	1. Single Dimension Array
	2. Multi Dimension Array
	3. Jagged Array
	
	Jagged Array is also known as Array of Arrays.
	
	1,2,3,4,5,6
	
	1,2,3
	4,5,6
	
	1,2,3,4,5
	1,2,3
	1,2,3,4,5,6,7
